# Disentangling covariates to predict counterfactuals (dis2p)
Causal generative model designed to disentangle known covariate variations from unknown ones at test time while simultaneously learning to make counterfactual predictions.


# Installation
If you have installed an older version of dis2p, uninstall it
```
pip uninstall dis2p
```
Download the requirements.txt file and install the required packages 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install dis2p 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Lotfollahi-lab/dis2p.git
```
